# 🚀 Autonomous Adaptive Portfolio & Risk Management Engine

A production-quality, modular portfolio management system that adapts to market regimes and implements sophisticated risk controls.

**This is NOT a stock predictor. This is a complete financial decision system.**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system implements a comprehensive portfolio management framework with:

- **Regime Detection**: Identifies market conditions (Trending Up/Down, High Volatility, Crash)
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adapts portfolio weights based on detected regimes
- **Risk Management**: Volatility targeting, drawdown control, position scaling
- **Backtesting**: Rolling window approach with no data leakage
- **Stress Testing**: Crisis scenario simulation
- **Explainability**: Human-readable decision explanations

## 🚀 Usage

### Option 1: Run Complete Analysis (Command Line)

Execute the full pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch historical data (SPY, QQQ, TLT, GLD) from 2015-present
2. Detect market regimes
3. Calculate allocations with and without risk management
4. Run backtests
5. Execute stress tests
6. Generate explanations
7. Save all reports to `reports/` folder

**Output:**
- Performance metrics comparison
- Equity curves and drawdown charts
- Stress test results
- Decision explanations

Launch the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

This provides:

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. Data Ingestion Module

- Fetches data using `yfinance`
- Calculates technical indicators (MA, volatility, returns)
- **No lookahead bias**: All features use only past data
- Handles missing data and alignment

### 2. Regime Detection Engine

Identifies four market regimes:

| Regime | Description | Characteristics |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Trending Up** | Bull market | Low vol, positive momentum |
| **Trending Down** | Bear market | Moderate vol, negative momentum |
| **High Volatility** | Uncertain market | High vol, mixed returns |
| **Crash** | Crisis | Extreme drawdown, panic |

Methods:
- Rule-based (thresholds)
- K-Means clustering (optional)

### 3. Allocation Engine

Strategies implemented:

- **Risk Parity**: Inverse volatility weighting
- **Momentum**: Weight by rolling returns
- **Correlation-Aware**: Penalize correlated assets

**Regime-Adaptive Allocation:**

| Regime | Equity % | Bond % | Gold % | Logic |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Trending Up | ↑ High | ↓ Low | ↓ Low | Favor growth |
| Trending Down | ↓ Medium | ↑ Medium | ↑ Medium | Balanced defensive |
| High Volatility | ↓ Low | ↑ High | ↑ High | Risk-off |
| Crash | ↓ Very Low | ↑ Very High | ↑ Very High | Maximum defense |

### 4. Risk Management Engine

Controls:

- **Volatility Targeting**: Target 12% annualized volatility
- **Drawdown Control**: Reduce exposure when drawdown exceeds 15%
- **Position Scaling**: Scale positions up/down based on realized risk
- **Stop-Loss**: Emergency reduction at 10% drawdown

### 5. Backtesting Framework

- Rolling window approach (no future data)
- Comprehensive metrics:
  - CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Sortino Ratio
  - Max Drawdown
  - Calmar Ratio

**Warning:** If Sharpe > 3, the system flags potential overfitting

### 6. Stress Testing Module

Scenarios:

1. **Market Crash**: -5% daily shock for 5 days
2. **Volatility Spike**: 3x volatility increase for 10 days
3. **Correlation Spike**: All assets move together downward

Compares portfolio with/without risk management under stress

### 7. Explainability Layer

Generates rule-based explanations like:

```
Regime detected: High Volatility
Portfolio volatility at 18.5% exceeds high threshold.
Elevated uncertainty in markets.

Allocation strategy for High Volatility regime:
Reducing equity exposure due to elevated volatility.
Increasing defensive assets (bonds, gold) by 40%.
Current allocation: SPY: 20%, QQQ: 20%, TLT: 35%, GLD: 25%
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Typical results (backtest from 2015-2024):

| Metric | Without Risk Mgmt | With Risk Mgmt |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| CAGR | ~8-10% | ~7-9% |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.6-0.8 | 0.8-1.2 |
| Max Drawdown | -25% to -35% | -15% to -20% |
| Calmar Ratio | 0.3-0.4 | 0.5-0.7 |

**Key Insight:** Risk management reduces returns slightly but significantly improves risk-adjusted performance

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component is independent and reusable
2. **No Lookahead Bias**: All calculations use only past data
3. **Explainability**: Every decision is traceable and interpretable
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new assets, regimes, or strategies
5. **Professional Standards**: Clean OOP, comprehensive documentation

### Key Assumptions

1. **Transaction Costs**: Not explicitly modeled (can be added)
